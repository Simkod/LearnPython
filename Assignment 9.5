# Assignment 9.4
# Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages.
# The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
# The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
# After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

# You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
