# Assignment 10.2
# Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
#	and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
# You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time
#	and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.
# Example line: From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
# Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour,
#	print out the counts, sorted by hour.

# You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
