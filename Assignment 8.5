# Assignment 8.5 

# Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line.
# When you find a line that starts with 'From' like the following line:
# "From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008"

# Parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line 
#	(i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message).
# Then print out a count at the end: "There were <count> lines in the file with From as the first word"

# Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.

# You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
